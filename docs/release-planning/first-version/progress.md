# ProPresenter OneDrive Setup Assistant - Implementation Progress

This document tracks the completion status of implementation steps for the first version release.

## ✅ Step 1: Create Core Script Infrastructure (Completed: 2025-06-27)

**Successfully implemented all core infrastructure components:**

### Files Created/Modified

- `ProPresenter-Setup-Assistant.command` - Main executable script with proper permissions
- `lib/` - Directory structure for modular components
- `logs/` - Directory for log file storage
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore configuration for logs and system files

### Key Features Implemented

**Enhanced Terminal UI System:**

- Dynamic colored terminal output using bash color codes (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, CYAN, NC)
- Intelligent header display with automatic text centering and dynamic border sizing
- Complete UI helper functions: `echo_header()`, `echo_step()`, `echo_status()`, `echo_success()`, `echo_error()`, `echo_warning()`, `echo_progress()`
- Progress tracking with step counters (1/10 format)

**Script Architecture:**

- Complete script structure with welcome screen and user confirmation
- Native macOS dialog integration using `osascript` for user interaction
- Graceful exit handling with cleanup functions and signal handlers (INT/TERM)
- Script metadata and version tracking system
- Comprehensive error logging to `./logs/setup-assistant.log`

**Environment Configuration Integration:**

- Automatic parsing of `docs/app-design/environment.md` configuration file
- Dynamic loading of tenant ID, domain, SharePoint URLs, and GitHub repository settings
- Validation of required configuration parameters
- Support for future configuration changes without code modifications

**Infrastructure Components:**

- Modular `lib/` directory structure ready for future components
- Organized logging system with automatic directory creation
- Git repository integration with proper ignore patterns
- Cross-platform macOS compatibility (13.0+)

### Verification Results

- ✅ Script launches successfully with executable permissions
- ✅ Colored welcome screen displays with proper text centering
- ✅ Environment configuration loads correctly (Tenant: b3873e62-b4ee-47e8-bb4d-e5ef560964af, Domain: mosaikkircheberlin.onmicrosoft.com)
- ✅ User interaction via native macOS dialogs functions properly
- ✅ Graceful exit handling and cleanup procedures work correctly
- ✅ Logging system creates organized log files in `./logs/` directory
- ✅ Git ignore configuration properly excludes logs and system files
- ✅ Script syntax validation passes without errors

### Technical Implementation Details

- Dynamic header rendering calculates exact spacing for perfect text centering
- Environment parsing uses robust grep/sed commands for reliable configuration extraction
- Log file management includes automatic directory creation and proper file permissions
- Error handling includes both terminal display and persistent logging
- User confirmation system integrates with macOS native dialog system

**Foundation Ready:** The core script infrastructure provides a solid foundation for implementing the remaining 10 steps of the implementation plan. All subsequent modules can build upon this established architecture, UI system, and configuration management.

## ✅ Step 2: Set Up GitHub Release Automation (Completed: 2025-06-27)

**Successfully implemented automated GitHub release infrastructure:**

### Files Created/Modified

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases
- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` - Complete release process documentation and guidelines
- `ProPresenter-Setup-Assistant.command` - Updated TOTAL_STEPS to 11 reflecting new implementation plan

### Key Features Implemented

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**

- Automatic trigger on semantic version tags matching pattern `v*.*.*` (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.2.3)
- Comprehensive validation phase including version tag format, script syntax, and permissions verification
- Environment configuration validation ensuring required tenant and SharePoint settings exist
- Automated ZIP packaging containing script, lib/, docs/ directories with standardized naming
- Release testing with package extraction and functionality validation
- Automatic release notes generation from commit history since previous version
- Asset upload with proper naming convention: `propresenter-setup-assistant-v{version}.zip`

**Release Process Documentation:**

- Complete step-by-step workflow documentation for creating releases
- Semantic versioning guidelines with examples (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Troubleshooting guide for common release issues
- Security considerations and best practices for public releases
- Release asset structure documentation showing ZIP contents
- Future enhancement roadmap including code signing and automated testing

**Version Management Infrastructure:**

- Semantic versioning validation preventing invalid tag formats
- Support for automated release creation via git tag pushing
- Integration with GitHub Releases API for future self-updating functionality
- Standardized release naming: "ProPresenter Setup Assistant v{version}"
- Release notes template with feature summaries and installation instructions

### Verification Results

- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow YAML syntax validation passed
- ✅ Workflow includes comprehensive validation steps (syntax, permissions, environment)
- ✅ ZIP packaging correctly includes all required components
- ✅ Release notes generation configured with commit history integration
- ✅ Semantic versioning validation properly implemented
- ✅ Release process documentation complete with troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Implementation plan updated with correct step numbering (11 total steps)

### Technical Implementation Details

- Workflow uses Ubuntu latest runner with proper GitHub token permissions
- ZIP packaging preserves executable permissions and directory structure
- Version extraction uses parameter expansion for reliable tag processing
- Release asset validation includes size checking and content verification
- Error handling includes detailed logging for debugging failed releases
- Network-dependent operations include retry logic and fallback mechanisms

**Release Infrastructure Ready:** The automated release system provides the foundation needed for Step 3 (Self-Updating Architecture) to query GitHub Releases API and download updates. The workflow creates reliable, tested releases that can be automatically discovered and downloaded by the script's update mechanism.

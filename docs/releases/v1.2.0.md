## Fixes

No critical fixes were required in this release as this builds upon a stable foundation.

## Details

### Dynamic Version Badge System

Implemented an intelligent version badge system that automatically detects user authentication status and displays the appropriate version information. This enhances user experience by providing relevant version information based on their access level.

### Automated README Version Updates

Enhanced the release workflow to automatically update version badges in README files during the release process. This ensures documentation always reflects the current release version without manual intervention.

### Release Workflow Improvements

Updated the prepare-pull-request workflow to use a centralized VERSION file instead of embedded version strings in script files. This simplifies version management and reduces the risk of version inconsistencies across the project.

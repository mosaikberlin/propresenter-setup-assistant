# Release: v1.1.0: ProPresenter Setup Assistant - Core Infrastructure and Release Automation

## Major Changes

This release establishes the foundational infrastructure for the ProPresenter OneDrive Setup Assistant with two major components:

1. **Core Script Infrastructure** - Complete terminal-based setup assistant with enhanced UI, environment configuration, and modular architecture
2. **GitHub Release Automation** - Automated CI/CD pipeline for creating tested, packaged releases via GitHub Actions

## Fixes

- Fixed header display centering to dynamically calculate spacing based on text length
- Organized logging system to use dedicated `logs/` directory instead of root directory
- Updated git ignore patterns to exclude logs and system files from repository

## Details

### Core Script Infrastructure (Step 1)

**Enhanced Terminal UI System:**
- Dynamic colored terminal output using bash color codes (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, CYAN, NC)
- Intelligent header display with automatic text centering and dynamic border sizing
- Complete UI helper functions: `echo_header()`, `echo_step()`, `echo_status()`, `echo_success()`, `echo_error()`, `echo_warning()`, `echo_progress()`
- Progress tracking with step counters

**Script Architecture:**
- Complete script structure with welcome screen and user confirmation
- Native macOS dialog integration using `osascript` for user interaction
- Graceful exit handling with cleanup functions and signal handlers (INT/TERM)
- Script metadata and version tracking system
- Comprehensive error logging to `./logs/setup-assistant.log`

**Environment Configuration Integration:**
- Automatic parsing of `docs/app-design/environment.md` configuration file
- Dynamic loading of tenant ID, domain, SharePoint URLs, and GitHub repository settings
- Validation of required configuration parameters
- Support for future configuration changes without code modifications

### GitHub Release Automation (Step 2)

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- Automatic trigger on semantic version tags matching pattern `v*.*.*`
- Comprehensive validation phase including version tag format, script syntax, and permissions verification
- Environment configuration validation ensuring required tenant and SharePoint settings exist
- Automated ZIP packaging containing script, lib/, docs/ directories with standardized naming
- Release testing with package extraction and functionality validation
- Automatic release notes generation from commit history since previous version

**Release Process Documentation:**
- Complete step-by-step workflow documentation for creating releases
- Semantic versioning guidelines with examples (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Troubleshooting guide for common release issues
- Security considerations and best practices for public releases
- Release asset structure documentation showing ZIP contents

**Version Management Infrastructure:**
- Semantic versioning validation preventing invalid tag formats
- Support for automated release creation via git tag pushing
- Integration with GitHub Releases API for future self-updating functionality
- Standardized release naming: "ProPresenter Setup Assistant v{version}"

### Smaller Changes

- Documentation updates for prepare-pull-request workflow to support script-based versioning

# Release: v2.0.0: OneDrive Shortcut Strategy - Simplified ProPresenter Configuration

## Major Changes

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Complete replacement of complex symlink-based configuration with direct OneDrive shortcut paths. This major version removes the intermediate symlink layer and dramatically simplifies the ProPresenter setup process.

### OneDrive Shortcut Strategy Implementation

- **Eliminated Complex Symlinks**: Removed 455+ lines of symlink creation and management code
- **Direct Path Configuration**: ProPresenter now configured with direct OneDrive CloudStorage paths
- **Simplified User Experience**: Changed from "Sync" to "Add shortcut to OneDrive" instructions
- **Reliable Path Detection**: CloudStorage-based detection with flexible keyword matching
- **Reduced Complexity**: Streamlined setup flow from 11 to 10 steps

### Enhanced SharePoint Integration

- **CloudStorage-Based Detection**: Direct search in `~/Library/CloudStorage` for definitive OneDrive location
- **Flexible Folder Matching**: Supports folders containing "Visuals", "Team", "ProPresenter" keywords
- **Improved Error Handling**: Clean path returns and comprehensive validation
- **Better User Guidance**: Clear instructions for shortcut creation vs sync

## Fixes

- **Fixed Folder Path Corruption**: Resolved debug output contaminating folder paths during detection
- **Improved Path Reliability**: Eliminated symlink-related path resolution issues
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Better user guidance for OneDrive shortcut setup failures

## Details

### Breaking Change: Symlink Removal

This release completely removes the complex symlink creation system (`lib/symlink-creation.sh`) that was causing reliability issues and maintenance overhead. The new approach uses direct OneDrive shortcut paths, which provides:

- **Better Reliability**: Fewer components that can fail
- **Easier Maintenance**: 305 lines of code removed while maintaining functionality
- **Consistent Paths**: All team members get identical folder structure
- **Native OneDrive Integration**: Uses built-in OneDrive shortcut functionality

**Migration Impact**: Existing installations will be automatically updated to use direct paths. The `~/ProPresenter-Sync/` symlink directory is no longer created or used.

### OneDrive Shortcut Strategy (Phase 1 & 2 Complete)

#### Phase 1: SharePoint Sync Instructions

- Updated user instructions to create OneDrive shortcuts instead of sync
- Implemented CloudStorage-based folder detection in `~/Library/CloudStorage`
- Fixed folder path detection and pinning for local file availability
- Enhanced error handling and logging for better troubleshooting

#### Phase 2: Configuration Simplification

- Removed `lib/symlink-creation.sh` module entirely
- Updated ProPresenter configuration to use `SHAREPOINT_SYNC_FOLDER` directly
- Simplified main script flow and reduced step count
- Maintained all safety features (backup, rollback, verification)

### Technical Improvements

**Detection Logic**:

- Searches directly in CloudStorage directory for OneDrive folders
- Uses regex for flexible keyword matching ("Visuals", "Team", "ProPresenter")
- Supports multiple OneDrive naming patterns and account types
- Returns clean folder paths without debug output contamination

**Configuration Management**:

- Direct path usage: `$SHAREPOINT_SYNC_FOLDER/Application Directory`
- Eliminated complex path mapping and normalization
- Preserved robust process management and user confirmation dialogs
- Comprehensive error handling with rollback capabilities

### Smaller Changes

- **docs**: Comprehensive progress documentation for both implementation phases
- **refactor**: Cleaned up module imports and step numbering
- **test**: Added syntax validation for simplified configuration flow
